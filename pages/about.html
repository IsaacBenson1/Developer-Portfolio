                I'm currently a Junior at the University of Minnesota<br>
                and am studying computer science. My coursework has <br>
                covered programming in Python, C, and Java, as well as  <br>
                algorithms, data structures, and discrete structures of  <br>
                computer science. On my own time, I have become  <br>
                proficient in JavaScript, node.js, graphQL, Ruby, TypeScript <br>
                postgreSQL, HTML and CSS. <br>

                I'm originally from Sioux Falls, SD, where I grew up <br>
                and graduated from Lincoln High School. For the  <br>
                last few years, I've worked several jobs between IT <br>
                and sales, and currently work as a computer specialist<br>
                at mTech, which is the University of Minnesotas main<br>
                supplier of technology to students and faculty.<br>
                Last summer, I worked as an IT intern with the <br>
                Sioux Falls School District, where I worked alongside <br>
                network engineers and system engineers to set up <br>
                the network for two newly built schools. <br>

                I'm extremely interested in working for a tech <br>
                company and writing code. Whether it be  <br>
                web development, software development, front end,  <br>
                back end, or anything in between, I'm extremely <br>
                excited to learn about what its like working <br>
                in tech. I deeply love coding, and am abundantly <br>
                excited to see where my journey in computer science <br>
                takes me.
